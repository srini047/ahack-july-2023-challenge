speed:
An important trait that determines a Pokémon's speed and attack order in battle. The higher the speed stat, the more advantage you have when attacking first.
These stats culminate in overall attributes, which are a general indicator of a Pokémon's overall power. Summarizing the stats above, the overall traits serve as a helpful guide when assessing the relative strength of each Pokémon.

Attack Defense Displot:
The Attack/Defense chart of the Pokemon dataset provides valuable insight into the characteristics of Pokemon teams. By examining the distribution of attack and defense statistics, we can draw some important conclusions.
First, the distinct spikes in the distplot indicate the existence of different clusters within the team. This suggests that Pokémon teams are made up of subgroups with different offensive and defensive attributes. This information allows you to identify different strengths and skills of your team members. Within the distribution, we observe moderate accumulation of attack and defense values. These Pokémon have a good balance of attack and defense, making them versatile and adaptable in battle. It is a reliable partner who plays an active part in various scenes.
In addition, we also found clusters with high offensive and defensive power. The team's powerful Pokémon boast outstanding offensive and defensive power. Their ability to withstand powerful attacks while delivering devastating strikes makes them the mainstay of the team in combat.
Additionally, outliers with unusually high attack or defense values ​​stand out in the distribution plot. These rare gems have extraordinary offensive or defensive power. They single-handedly have the potential to turn the tide of battle and are invaluable to the team.
Analyzing the distribution can also help you strategize your team. A distribution focused on high attack stats indicates an aggressive playstyle focused on overpowering opponents. Conversely, a distribution that tends to have higher defensive stats suggests a more defensive approach that emphasizes stamina and survival.
Overall, the attack/defense chart provides insight into team composition, balance, and potential strategy. This allows you to assess the strengths and weaknesses of individual Pokémon and make informed decisions about team composition, combat tactics, and training priorities.
